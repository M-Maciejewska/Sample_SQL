/* Write three separate queries, in the following order, to accomplish the tasks listed below:
Insert a new project into the projects table with the following details:

Business ID (business_id): 2
Project type (project_type): 'Software'
Payment sum (payment): 150000
Status (status): 'WAITING'
No dependence on any other project (depends_on_project_id): NULL
Priority (priority): 'LOW'
Update the status column of the project entry in the projects table with the project ID (id) of 4 to be 'IN PROGRESS'.
Return all data from the projects table, ensuring that rows with NULL in the depends_on_project_id column explicitly indicate 'N/A' instead.
The returned results should consist of the following seven columns, in this exact order:

id
business_id
project_type
payment
status
depends_on_project_id â€” Replace NULL values with 'N/A'
priority

The returned results should also be ordered by the id column in ascending order. */
